<h6><p>My name is Queenie Lorraine P. Manindo the second born child of my parents whose Rowena Manindo and Laurel Manindo. In our family we arethree and I am the second born child where my birthday
is September 15,2002 and I am now sixteen. I did finish my Elementary Education at Sta.Fe Elementary School(now Eliceo C. Sioson,Sr Elementary School) a small school in our sitio at South Upi Maguindanao.
I completed my Junior High School at Saint Francis High School located at Nuro Upi, Mag. batch 2017-2018.n After that I am now in my Senior High School whose cureently studying at Notre Dame-RVM College
of Cotabato(ND-RVMCC)which is one of the Three Catholic School in Cotabato City. I did take up the STEM strand stands for Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics in preparation for the course that
I am going to take up in the near future.</h6></p>

<h6><p>Aside from those informations I am also a part of our church Lectors and Comentators Ministry(LCM),my hobbies are reading stories,watching movies, also writing English terms that aren't familiar to me coming from many different movies that I am watching. I like popcorns,prawn crackers, desserts,vegetables(not all) and fruits but I am not eating Durian because for me it's gross and it's one of cause of High Blood Pressure. For those places that I'ved gone through I want the thing that I can go to places that are near here at Cotabato City like Balut Island at Lebat Sultan Kudarat, Asik-Asik Falls at Midsayap and Mt. Minandar
at I don't know where it is. I also like K-Pop and K-Drama's because of the beat of the songs even though I can't understand  it and K-Dramas are kinda motivating drama for they show that Always try and do your best
and at the end you will gather all the fruits of your success. Another thing is,one of the things that I am doing after school time sometimes is to eat street foods others says that street foods are unhealthy but for
me it is also unhealthy but maybe trying something new for it is the best thing you could do but just limit yourself. From one of those Million viewers on youtube I am also one of the fan of 1million Dance Studio I am also helping in preapartion our church and playing Volleyball every Festivities of our Church Chapel.</h6></p> 

<h6><p>Based from what I believe"Let others tell who you are and you will know", it relays a message to me that you know you are but other  will truly know because they were the one's with you in your life. 
I did ask my seatmtes now and friends way back in my Junior High School about" What do I show them?"(personality) and they told me that I am childish,talkative, industrious in my studies, and a friend that always listens to them.
I was overwhelmed from what they sy but in addition to those traits that they sw to me I am also shy in participating in Oral Recitations in School and other because now a days there are people who will always judge you
no matter what, I am also quite sometimes in times when I like the subject or the teacher is strict, I have the attitude of 'I don't care if you don't like me' and the attitude of I'll notice you and be friends with you,lastly yes I am childish
yet that's only when I want you to smile,to make fun of you also I can act formal and set aside my childishness</h6></p>
