<h6><p>What I Am and What I Want?. What really I am?, it's a question that I can somehow answer yet I am still searching for the complete episode of Who I am. I am the person that is fund of reading pocket books, wattpad, novel, English books where I can learn something nor interesting that I can practice 
my English. I am the person that will be by your side no matter what cause I feel that being with someone that really cares for you means a big thing to that person, I am an introvert sometimes but most of the time my attitude of being a childish comes out specially when those people around me knows me.
I am always thinking of doing eveything(shool stuffs) ahead of time but get easily distracted when theres an internet. I am the person the person that the grades in my report card is really a big thing,for me it's importat even for others not cause based from what I know near in the future they alwasy look
at your perfromance in school whish is somehow represented in the Report Card(I don't know if it's true.).</p></h6>

<h6><p>Everyone loves to travel for they seek some adventures, places to go to and many reasons. For me I want to go tom places where I spent my money and not my Parebt's. I want to travel places to places yet for now I want to go to places thats near to where I live(for now). I want to have the college
life where Me and My friends are in one place and helping each other. I want those friends that tells me bad words yet they only want is the best for me and those friends that will always say the truth on your face and not making a wrong rumor about you. I have plenty of dreams since I was young(it's normal to children)
of 'I want to be like that',and 'I want to be like her/him'. Let's start to the first "What I want", the first dream that I told myself was "I Want to be a Teacher" that's when the time where my favorite teacher is our teacher that time. That the first I Want that became somehow my dream, the succeding I want that
I have wasn't really what I want. I became dependent on what my mother wants me to be becasue honestly until now I dont Have that specific "What I want". Many asked me 'ano corse mo pag college mo?', 'ano kunin mo sa college' some I anwered and some I didn't for the reason that evenn though I am in my Senior High School
stage I am still searching for the missing piece in my life that would tell what ecxactly I want to be.   </p></h6>
